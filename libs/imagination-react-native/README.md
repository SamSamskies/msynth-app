# imagination made with React Native
This is a new way of programming art. This app will serve as a display of different artworks made with the imagination library.

## What is imagination?
Imagination for devices takes your accelerometer and turns it into a color. It was created by Matzie for Matzielab as an experimental way of interaction response.

## What is it good for?
Nothing and everything! It's basically just a visual response to movement or orientation. This app displays the usage of it in combination with visual art.

## How can i help out?
Imagination is always in the need of artists. If you're into making visual art, illustrations or animations or have any other idea of how to make artworks with this, hit me up and you'll be part of this universe.
